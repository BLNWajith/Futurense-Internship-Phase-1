# Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard Project

Welcome to our Analytics Dashboard Project, where we delve into the heart of data to uncover insights, trends, and predictions that drive strategic decision-making. Our project is structured into four core sections: Descriptive Analysis, Diagnostic Analysis, Predictive Analysis, and Prescriptive Analysis. Each section utilizes specific analysis types and visualization tools to bring our data to life. Let's dive in!

## 1. Descriptive Analysis

In this section, we explore the data as it is, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis.

### Average Ratings and Reviews
