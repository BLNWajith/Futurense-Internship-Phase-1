<h4 align="left">Data Structure 2</h4>

###

<p align="left">Q1 Description:<br>This Python program is designed to calculate the product by multiplying all the numbers present in each given tuple. It iterates through each number in the tuple, multiplies them together, and prints the final product for each original tuple provided. The function prod_of_tuples is responsible for calculating the product, and it's tested with tuples containing both positive and negative numbers as well as a variety of integers to demonstrate its functionality.<br><br>Q2 Description:<br>However, there seems to be a mistake in the provided code for calculating the average value of numbers in a tuple of tuples. The intention of the program is to compute and display the average values of corresponding elements across the tuples contained within a larger tuple. This means each position in the resulting list of averages should reflect the average value at that position across all inner tuples. The function avg_of_tuples aims to accomplish this by iterating over the tuples and calculating the averages, but the implementation needs correction to accurately perform as described. Specifically, it should average across the same positions in each tuple and fix the incorrect appending operation.</p>

<h2 align="left">Data Cleaning & Processing Overview</h2>

###

<h4 align="left">Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data preprocessing, is a crucial step in the data science pipeline that involves identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the data to improve its quality and usability.<br><br>" src = geeksforgeeks "</h4>

###

<p align="left">During the stage where we clean and process the data, our goal is to polish the Netflix dataset so we can analyze it accurately. First off, we take a good look at how the dataset is organized to get a grip on what we're dealing with. Some of the main things we do include spotting and getting rid of any rows that are missing information to keep our data solid. We also change the name of the 'listed_in' column to 'genre' to make it more understandable. After we've cleaned everything up, we go back and double-check the dataset to make sure our cleaning efforts did the trick. And we don't forget to look for any duplicates, because we want to keep our dataset one of a kind. These steps are super important to make sure we're building a strong foundation for a data analysis that's both reliable and packed with insights.</p>

<h2 align="left">EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

###

<h4 align="left">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the method of studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is normally carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking extra formal statistical analyses or modeling.<br><br>" src = geeksforgeeks "</h4>

<h3 align="left">Visualizing Content Types Distribution</h3>

###

<p align="left">We start by examining the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows available on Netflix. A count plot reveals the prevalence of each type, providing a visual understanding of Netflix's content strategy.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Investigate Movie Durations</h3>


###

<p align="left">Focusing on movies, we clean the 'duration' column by converting it to integers and removing the 'min' suffix. This process enables us to analyze movie durations effectively, including plotting a histogram to visualize the distribution of movie lengths.</p>
